task 1:
To implement the first part that is finding the fft, ifft,dct and magnitude i have used the formulas that where mentioned in the lecture slides and i have written the code for them.

Task 2:
To implement the filtering part of the assignment i have used the formulas maentioned the lecture slides for building the masks for the filters and then i have followed the steps
required for filtering as mentioned in the filteroing function of the assignment . finally i have found the magnitude of the dft and filterdft and printed the images of all of them.
