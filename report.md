task 1:
To implement the first part that is finding the fft, ifft,dct and magnitude i have used the formulas that where mentioned in the lecture slides and i have written the code for them.

Task 2:
To implement the filtering part of the assignment i have used the formulas maentioned the lecture slides for building the masks for the filters and then i have followed the steps required for filtering as mentioned in the filtering function of the assignment . finally i have found the magnitude of the dft and filterdft and printed the images of all of them including the final filtered image.

inorder to execute the self.filter for all the filters i have added order=0 for all the mask functions.
